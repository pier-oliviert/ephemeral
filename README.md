Managing ephemeral environment in your kubernetes cluster

## Development

### Podman machine

The default machine might not have enough CPU to run the whole environment as many pods needs to run and each of them have a resource quotas set. By default on OSX, the machine only has 1 CPU. It's preferrable to have 4 to make sure everything works fine.

```sh
podman machine init --cpus=4
```

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. It's recommended to use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) as it was created to generate cluster rapidly with configuration files and such a config file exists in this repo to help you get started.

### KIND

It is recommended to create a cluster using the configuration file present in this repository.

```sh
kind create cluster --config kind.config.yaml
```

### Dependencies

For the operator to work properly, [Cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) and [NGINX controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) need to be running. You can follow the deployment guide provided in their documentation or you can
use the following commands to install them in your KIND cluster.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
```

### Building from source

Each subproject can be deployed to the KIND cluster the same way. First, the project needs to be build and published to the local docker environment using a `$TAG` of your choosing, in the example below, the tag is `operator`. Once the build is completed,
it can be uploaded to the KIND cluster by using `kind load docker-image $TAG`.

```sh
export TAG=operator
cd operator/
docker build -t $TAG .
kind load docker-image $TAG
```

### Installing CRDs on the cluster

```sh
cd operator/
make generate
make manifest
make deploy
```

### Admission Webhooks

Admission webhooks are only supported if the operator is running *inside* a cluster. This means that if you run the operator through `make run` it will raise an error on startup. You can disable the admission webhooks from the operator by using an environment variable.

**Note:** If you plan on running the operator within the KIND cluster, this step is not needed.

```sh
DISABLE_WEBHOOKS=true make run
```


### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### Admission webhook certificates

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
